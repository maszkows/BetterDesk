## Maintainers

Branching, update flow, installer contracts: **[important/README.md](important/README.md)**.

Dated audits, roadmaps, and one-off plans are **historical** — see [archive/](archive/) when present, or treat root-level `AUDIT_*` / `*_ROADMAP_*` / `*_PLAN_*` files as non-user docs (do not link them from the wiki Home).

## Changelog

Use the root **[CHANGELOG.md](../CHANGELOG.md)** only. The old `development/CHANGELOG.md` file is a stub redirect.
